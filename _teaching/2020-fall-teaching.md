Course description: The goal of this course is to increase your understanding of the methods underlying magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in humans, including experimental design, image processing, and statistics, through reading of journal articles and hands-on analysis. It is impossible to understand neuroimaging without spending significant time analyzing data: classes are split evenly between discussing primary journal articles and hands-on analysis.
