Functional Neuroimaging Methods

Graduate level course PSYCH 4450

Washington University in St.Louis, Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences

Format: Virtual, FALL 2020

Course description: The goal of this course is to increase your understanding of the methods underlying magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in humans, including experimental design, image processing, and statistics, through reading of journal articles and hands-on analysis. It is impossible to understand neuroimaging without spending significant time analyzing data: classes are split evenly between discussing primary journal articles and hands-on analysis.
