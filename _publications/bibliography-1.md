Abstract: Extracting clinical entities from unstructured healthcare data is a critical task in natural language processing (NLP) as a vast majority of patient data is stored in an unstructured format. Accurately identifying entities provides additional insights on patients and assists clinical decision-making. However, extracting information from real-world unstructured healthcare data presents significant challenges because of the heterogeneity of the data and there have been limited studies identifying the most effective approach for clinical entity extraction tasks. The aim of this research is to evaluate most recent NLP models and generate insights into the applicability and limitations of these models for extracting real-world clinical entities. More specifically, in this paper, we compare the performance of two most recent hybrid rule-based and machine learning-based approaches, and deep learning-based approaches for an entity extraction task from highly unprocessed and unstructured clinical text data. In addition, we highlight challenges encountered in identifying entities, specifically those related to negation and speculation.
