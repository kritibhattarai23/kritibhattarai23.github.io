This paper presents a framework for enhancing clinical entity and relation extraction at the document level using knowledge base-guided generation. By integrating the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) with generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) models, the proposed method improves the identification of clinical entities and their relationships. The framework dynamically maps relevant UMLS concepts to the clinical text and incorporates these mappings into the prompt used for GPT models. Experiments conducted on the n2c2 and ADE datasets demonstrate significant improvements in precision, recall, and F1 scores compared to few-shot learning approaches without UMLS integration. Additionally, this approach outperforms the standard Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique. The results highlight the advantages of combining UMLS's comprehensive domain-specific knowledge with GPT's contextual understanding, thereby achieving higher accuracy and better handling of linguistic variations in clinical text. The study underscores the potential of knowledge-based methods in advancing information extraction tasks in specialized domains like healthcare.
